NBA Data Analysis using Python and SciPy
NBA Data Analysis using Python and SciPy
Purpose

The purpose of this project is to perform numerical data analysis using Python and the SciPy library on NBA player statistics data.

Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
SciPy
Matplotlib

Project Overview
Filtered dataset to include only NBA Regular Season data.
Identified the player with the most regular seasons played.
Calculated three-point percentage per season.
Performed linear regression on three-point accuracy.
Computed average accuracy using integration of the regression line.
Estimated missing seasons using interpolation.
Calculated mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis for FGM and FGA.
Performed paired and independent t-tests comparing FGM and FGA.

Key Findings
Field Goal Attempts (FGA) are significantly higher than Field Goals Made (FGM).
Both distributions show positive skew.
Regression shows a slight downward trend in 3-point percentage over time.
T-tests confirmed a statistically significant difference between FGM and FGA.

Limitations
Some seasons required interpolation.
Linear regression assumes a linear relationship.
Results depend on available dataset years.
